## Step 1: Create an account

Quick sign-up is via the the ```registerUserFromSchoolablePay``` mutation on the [Core User](https://api.schoolablesandbox.com/graphql/core/user) endpoint
on our Apollo GraphQL studio.

<Note>You can create an account by simply supplying only the required parameters</Note>

After creating an account, you will receive an email with an OTP or link to verify your account. Click on the link to verify your account.

## Step 2: Create an API key

After verifying your account, you may then go ahead to create an access token. You can create an access token on any of our enviroments by 
simply supplying your registered email address and password. After that, you should get an access token that you can now add to your authentication header
to gain unrestricted access our API services.
