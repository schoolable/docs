When you sign up to Schoolable, you get access to two environments; Sandbox and Production.

Our Sandbox environment uses test data and allow you to test integrations before shipping them to production. 
Our Production environment, on the other hand, uses live data and should not be used for testing.

<Info>Both environments require authentication.</Info>
