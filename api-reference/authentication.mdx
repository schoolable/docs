description: "Authorize your API calls with API access tokens"

Authenticate your API calls on each of our [environments](../home/environments) by generating access tokens and adding them in the authorization header of your requests.

<Warning>Access tokens differ for different environments i.e access tokens for sandbox environment will not authorize requests on production.</Warning>

### Authenticating REST API calls on Swagger

All our REST APIs reside on Swagger. <br/> 

Thus, authenticating your REST API calls is done via our [Swagger Playground](https://api.schoolablesandbox.com/rest/swagger/#/). All you need is an access token which can be generated by 
inputting your Schoolable-registered email address and corresponding password as values for the appropriate parameters on the **Login User** endpoint, i.e ```rest/auth/login``` on the ```auth``` section of the page.

<Note> The ```eposTerminalId``` parameter is optional. </Note>

A successful authentication should generate an access token and return a status code 200. The access token generated can then be included in the 
authorization header you can find by clicking on the "Authorize" button at the top-right of the page. 

```bash
'Value': <access_token>
```
After including the access token, go ahead and click the "Authorize" button and you should now be able to make hitch-free API requests via our REST endpoints.



## Authenticating GraphQL API calls on the Apollo Studio Explorer

All GraphQL API queries require a valid access token. 

You can access all the GraphQL endpoints via the Apollo Studio Explorer. Authentication of GraphQL requests is done via the ```loginWithPassword``` query on the ```core/user```
endpoint. For more information, see the [Environments](../home/environments) page.

Authenticating all your GraphQL requests on the Apollo playground is similar to that authentication on Swagger, i.e., you also need your Schoolable-registered email address and corresponding password as values for the appropriate query parameters
