description: "Authorize your API calls with API access tokens"

Authenticate your API calls on each of our [environments](../home/environments) by generating access tokens and adding them in the authorization header of your requests.

<Warning>Access tokens differ for different environments i.e access tokens for sandbox environment will not authorize requests on production.</Warning>

## Authenticating REST API calls on Swagger

All our REST APIs reside on Swagger. <br/> 
Thus, your REST API calls can only be authenticated via our [Swagger Playground](https://api.schoolablesandbox.com/rest/swagger/#/). 
All you need is an access token which can be generated by inputting your Schoolable-registered email address and corresponding password 
as values for the appropriate parameters on the **Login User** endpoint, i.e ```rest/auth/login``` on the ```auth``` section of the page.

<Note> The ```eposTerminalId``` parameter is optional. A successful authentication should return an access token and a status code 200. </Note>

The access token generated can then be included in the authorization header you can find by clicking on 
the "Authorize" button at the top-right of the page. 

```bash
'Value': <access_token>
```

After including the access token, go ahead and click the "Authorize" button and you should now be able to make hitch-free API requests via our REST endpoints.


## Authenticating GraphQL API calls on the Apollo Studio Explorer

All GraphQL API queries, mutation and objects reside on our [Apollo Studio Explorer](https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/explorer). 

Authenticating all your GraphQL requests on the Apollo playground is similar to authentication on Swagger in that 
you also need your Schoolable-registered email address and corresponding password as values for the appropriate query parameters. However, 
Authentication of GraphQL requests is done via the ```loginWithPassword``` query on the ```core/user```
endpoint. For more information, see the [Environments](../home/environments) page.
